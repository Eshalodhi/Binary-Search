# Binary-Search
Description: Efficiently searches a sorted array for a target element in 𝑂(log𝑛) time.
Usage: Clone repository, execute Binary_Search.ipynb, and input a sorted list and target element.
Algorithm: Divides the search space in half until the target is found.
Example: Input [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], target 40, output: Index 3.
Features: Clear implementation with example cases.
